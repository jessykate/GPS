* Machine Learning
  + auto-determination of locations and routes to a given threshold of
    detail
  + path determination from noisy routes
  + curve approximation from discrete points
    + with terrain as a guide
    + with multiple data sets
  + auto-labelling of data using business/residence listings
  + auto determination of tie points for image warping (sharp curves,
    distinct features)

* Statistical correlations
  + correlation between time spent at primary/secondary locations
    (work? home?) and lifestyle/income/profession/etc.
  + super/sublinear scaling of distances/travel times to primary
    locations, meet points, etc. (cf. paper: superlinear scaling in
    cities).
  + characteristic travel distance per person
